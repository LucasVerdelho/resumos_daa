# Learning Systems

Learning systems represent a computational paradigm where the essential characteristic of the system lies in its ability to learn autonomously and independently. These systems are driven by data, meaning their learning capability is fueled by data.

- **Data-Driven Algorithms:**
  - In a data-driven context, algorithms base their learning on available data. For instance, consider a hypothetical algorithm that learns the concept of a table through an algorithmic definition of the table's configuration.

  - **Machine Learning:**
    - An important aspect is that Machine Learning algorithms learn without the explicit need for coding the solution to a problem. Instead, they learn from examples and data provided during training.

    - For example, a Machine Learning algorithm could learn to identify tables from various examples of tables, developing the ability to determine whether a specific object is or isn't a table based on the knowledge acquired during training.


# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a learning paradigm where the cases used for learning contain information about the intended outcomes, allowing the establishment of a relationship between the desired values and the values produced by the system.

- **Predominance in Machine Learning:**
  - The majority of Machine Learning algorithms operate using supervised learning.

- **Definition of Supervised Learning:**
  - In supervised learning, the input data (x) and the corresponding outcomes (y) enable the algorithm to learn a mapping function (f) that transforms input data into desired outcomes: \( y = f(x) \).

- **Supervision Aspect:**
  - The term "supervised" indicates that this mapping is accompanied by a teacher or trainer who oversees the learning process.

- **Two Main Categories:**
  1. **Classification:**
      - Applicable when outcomes are discrete, such as categorizing into classes like black, white, or gray.
  2. **Regression:**
      - Used when outcomes are continuous, representing variables like temperature or sunlight variation throughout the day.

Supervised learning is a powerful approach in Machine Learning, providing a structured framework for teaching algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on labeled training data.


# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a learning paradigm where outcomes of cases are not known; only the statements of problems are available. This necessitates the choice of learning techniques that assess the internal functioning of the system.

- **Essence of Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Unsupervised learning implies the presence of input data (x) without corresponding outcomes.

- **Objective of Unsupervised Learning:**
  - The primary goal of this type of learning is to model the structure or distribution of the data in the problem.

- **Two Main Categories:**
  1. **Clustering:**
      - Applied when the aim is to organize data into coherent groups (e.g., grouping customers who purchase sugary drinks).

  2. **Association:**
      - Used when the goal is to discover rules that associate behaviors demonstrated by the data (e.g., people who buy sugary drinks do not buy alcoholic beverages).

Unsupervised learning techniques are typically employed in scenarios where the desired outcomes are unknown, and the objective is to uncover patterns, relationships, or structures within the data. Clustering helps in organizing similar data points into groups, while association explores connections and rules within the data.


# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a learning paradigm that, despite lacking information about the intended outcomes, allows for an evaluation of whether the produced results are good or bad.

- **Characteristics of Reinforcement Learning:**
  - Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning utilize self-feedback mechanisms to improve results, influenced by the concept of reward/punishment.

- **Distinction from Supervised Learning:**
  - Reinforcement Learning cannot be directly compared to Supervised Learning since there is not an absolute absence of information about outcomes.

- **Learning through Self-Critique:**
  - Learning in this paradigm occurs through the algorithm's ability to critically assess its own produced results.

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:**
  1. **Q-Learning:**
      - Assumes following an optimal policy and uses it to update the values of actions.

  2. **SARSA:**
      - Considers the control policy being followed and updates the value of actions accordingly.

Reinforcement Learning stands out for its ability to make decisions through trial and error, where the algorithm receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to learn optimal strategies over time.
